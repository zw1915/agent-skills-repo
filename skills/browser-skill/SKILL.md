# browser-skill

Use `bsk` to work in an **Agent Window** with the user's existing logins. User tabs
require explicit borrowing. This skill does not install the extension or handle
advice-only tasks. Never extract credentials, cookies, tokens, or other secrets.

## Before starting a session

For remote setup or pairing, follow the [remote guide](https://github.com/Tencent/BrowserSkill/blob/main/docs/remote-extension-connection.md).

Local commands normally auto-start the daemon. If the host terminates background
children after each shell call, including on Windows, complete these steps first:

1. Reuse the host daemon's existing `BSK_HOME` (or its default if unset). Set
  `BSK_AUTO_START=0` and run `bsk status --json`. Reuse a working daemon; an empty
   `browsers` list means the extension still needs connecting. Permission errors,
   timeouts or invalid replies do not prove the daemon is absent.
2. Only if the check reports a missing daemon and no host task is already starting
  it, run `bsk daemon start --foreground` with the same `BSK_HOME` in the host's
   approved persistent background task outside the per-command sandbox. Keep that
   task alive; `--foreground` alone cannot prevent host cleanup. The
   [sandbox guide](https://github.com/Tencent/BrowserSkill/blob/main/docs/sandboxed-agents.md)
   covers the normal host-terminal alternative and PowerShell examples.
3. After launching, or if a host task is already starting the daemon, run
  `bsk status --json` in a **separate shell tool call** with the same `BSK_HOME`
   and `BSK_AUTO_START=0`. While startup is pending, make at most five
   checks with one-second pauses for missing-endpoint or transient startup errors;
   stop on permission/protocol errors. Proceed only after a successful status
   response. If the host task exits (including a lock error) or readiness never
   succeeds, inspect its output and `bsk logs`, then recheck status for another
   daemon before deciding whether startup is still needed. Report unresolved
   errors; do not loop on launches, delete runtime files or restart a shared daemon.

Use the same `BSK_HOME` and `BSK_AUTO_START=0` on EVERY sandboxed command;
environment settings may not persist between shell calls. Keep browser commands
sandboxed. For other startup failures, retry once, then use `bsk doctor`.
A local process identity warning permits browser commands when IPC works.

## Task workflow

1. Define success from the user's request. Start `bsk session start --json` and
  retain its `session_id`. With multiple browsers, run `bsk browsers` and add
   `--browser <id-or-label>` to start. For background work, add `--no-focus` to
   `session start` only.
2. For a new page, navigate; for an existing user tab, follow **Borrowing** below.
  Read the page before interacting:
3. Choose an action using fresh refs from that observation. Observe again after
  navigation or meaningful DOM changes. Check an ambiguous result once; once
   success is visible, stop acting rather than refreshing or checking again.
4. Always run `bsk session stop <id>` on success and failure, unless keeping the
  session open is part of the user's request. This also returns borrowed tabs.
   Returned tabs stay open in the user's window. Do not rely on idle cleanup
   or stop/restart the shared daemon to finish a task.

Replace `<id>`, example refs and values with actual results and task inputs.
Every session-scoped command needs `--session <id>`; `session stop` takes the ID
positionally. For unfamiliar commands or flags, consult `bsk --help` or
`bsk <command...> --help` instead of guessing; no need to read all help at startup.
When following a trace, use its semantic targets and values in order, not its old
refs. Stop at the requested goal; a trace grants no additional authorization.

## Read and interact

Prefer `observe` for text, controls and `@eN` refs. Navigation invalidates refs;
large DOM changes can stale them too. Re-observe before the next interaction.
Use refs for iframe/shadow-root targets; CSS selectors search the main document.

Choose the relevant example, using a ref that actually appeared on the page:


| Need                    | Command                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Click                   | `bsk click @e3 --session <id>`                                 |
| Fill a field            | `bsk fill @e3 --value "text" --session <id>`                   |
| Select an option        | `bsk select @e3 --value "option-value" --session <id>`         |
| Press a key             | `bsk press Enter --ref @e3 --session <id>`                     |
| Reveal a hover menu     | `bsk hover @e3 --session <id>`                                 |
| Reveal an element       | `bsk scroll-to @e3 --session <id>`                             |
| Scroll with wheel input | `bsk wheel --delta-y 600 --session <id>`                       |
| Focus or leave a field  | `bsk focus @e3 --session <id>` / `bsk blur @e3 --session <id>` |


- `select` uses the option's value, not its visible label.
- Hover markers such as `[hover first: Shoes | Bags]`, `[has-submenu]`, or
`[expanded]` identify triggers. Hover the trigger, observe, then use the revealed
item's ref. Listed labels are not refs; do not click the trigger unless its own
action is wanted. If an expected control is missing and no marker identifies a
trigger, try `observe --probe-hover` once. It touches the live page and costs
seconds; use targeted hover once the trigger is known.
- `scroll-to` returns ancestor-clipped bounds in top-level viewport CSS pixels.
Partial visibility suffices; hidden/fully clipped targets fail. It does not test
occlusion. `wheel` sends signed deltas (at least one nonzero), not a guaranteed
scroll distance. An optional target is scrolled into view first; without one,
input lands at the viewport centre. Observe to check the page's response.

Use `snapshot` for a static accessibility tree, `get-html` for exact markup or
hidden metadata, and `screenshot` for visual content or requested visual evidence.
Do not start with HTML/images just to find ordinary controls; obtain fresh refs
before interacting with controls found that way.

### Large observations

There is no default token cap. With `observe --max-tokens <n>`, follow a returned
`next_cursor`/`@more` when relevant content remains:

```sh
bsk observe --cursor <token> --session <id>
```

Each page replaces the ref map: use its refs before continuing and never reuse
refs from earlier pages. Continuation reads the same capture, without refreshing
or hovering; do not combine it with depth changes or hover probing. New observe/
snapshot or changed page identity invalidates continuation; then observe afresh.

## Borrowing and browser settings

List before borrowing, and return the tab as soon as the relevant step ends:

```sh
bsk tab list --scope user --session <id>
bsk tab borrow <tab-id> --session <id>
bsk tab return <tab-id> --session <id>
```

Never invent tab IDs or keep a user tab across unrelated work. Do not repeat
pending, denied or timed-out borrows. For `borrow_outcome_unknown`, inspect tab/
session state first: the tab may already have moved. Do not bypass an outcome
through another browser backend. `tab borrow --timeout 120s` changes only the
confirmation wait (default 60s); custom waits require daemon and extension protocol 1.2+.

The extension's saved Automation settings control borrow confirmation and human
help independently; both default on and apply to existing sessions too. Read
`interaction` in `session start --json` or `session list --json` when needed.
Deprecated `--unattended`, `--no-confirm`, and `BSK_REQUEST_HELP=off` cannot override
these settings. Never change browser storage/settings to bypass them. Human-help
availability does not require permission for every action or grant extra authority.
`request-help` requires daemon protocol 1.3; update CLI, daemon and extension for
full settings support. A feature's version error does not disable other operations.

Remote content reads/actions require task-created or borrowed tabs. Page-opened
popups gain no control automatically; an unowned tab inside the Agent Window
needs the user to move it to a user window before borrowing. Remote upload/download
are unsupported; screenshots work.

## Human steps and recovery

With help enabled, request help for login, CAPTCHA, OTP, payment confirmation,
consent, or after two attempts make no progress:

```sh
bsk request-help --session <id> --prompt "Please complete sign-in" --target @e3
```

Use a precise prompt and fresh targets; omit `--target` when no control fits.
Use completion criteria only for a clear, stable success signal.


| Result                         | Next step                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Help `continued` / `completed` | Observe again, then resume with fresh refs.                                                                                          |
| Help `cancelled` / `timed_out` | Respect rejection or the blocker; do not repeat the request.                                                                         |
| Help `disabled`                | No human action was confirmed. Re-observe and follow the disabled-help rules below.                                                  |
| Stale ref                      | Observe and retry the intended action once.                                                                                          |
| Unknown tab/session            | List current tabs/sessions; never guess IDs or use another task's session.                                                           |
| Timeout or unknown effect      | Inspect current state before retrying; the action may already have happened.                                                         |
| `fill_value_mismatch`          | Read the field: formatting may still satisfy the request. Correct only a remaining difference; no blind refill or immediate handoff. |
| Unsupported operation          | Use available capabilities; suggest updating only if the missing feature is needed.                                                  |


Navigation alone (including deprecated help outcome `navigated`) is not completion.
For other errors, follow the returned hint and inspect the current state.

**Help disabled:** do not request help or re-enable it. Use existing login state,
authorized inputs and viable alternatives; disabling help adds no permission and
does not remove borrow confirmation or host restrictions. Where authorized, a
vision-capable model may attempt graphical verification. Phone-only QR scans,
face verification, missing SMS codes or image-only tasks for a text-only model
may remain blocked. Report a specific blocker only when inputs/capabilities are
missing or viable approaches are exhausted; continue independent work. Do not loop
on identical failures, repeat unknown effects or switch backends to bypass limits.
On an unrecoverable failure, report the blocker and stop the owned session.

## Screenshots and Canvas

```sh
bsk screenshot --session <id> --out viewport.png
bsk screenshot --session <id> --ref @e3 --out element.png --json
bsk screenshot --session <id> --full-page --out page.png
bsk screenshot --session <id> --full-page --scope current --out loaded.png
```

Screenshots return a local PNG path; view the image to interpret it. `--out`
replaces an existing file; omitting it uses a temporary path. `--json` includes
dimensions and byte size. `--ref` and `--full-page` cannot be combined.

Full-page mode scrolls an ordinary webpage and restores its position/styles.
The default `--scope follow` follows appended content. Use `--scope current` when
capturing the currently loaded range is requested: it stops at the initial document
height, even if a loading indicator remains. Later content below that boundary is
excluded; report this range rather than claiming all feed entries were loaded.
Use a selected, session-controlled tab and stable viewport; `--tab-id` targets a
tab without selecting it. Internal browser pages, the Web Store, nested scrolling
panels and virtualized lists are unsupported. Capture/encoding defaults to 2m;
`--timeout 5m` extends it only in full-page mode. Allow the shell enough time for
capture plus transfer. Respect cancellation; do not blindly retry endless pages
or substitute a viewport image when an older extension rejects full-page capture.
Use matching CLI/extension builds. Ctrl-C cancels; failed full-page captures save
no partial image. A `loading_stalled` error means the bottom kept a loading
indicator without height growth for 30s; do not simply increase the deadline.
Choose `current` only when that range satisfies the request. Keep the capture tab
visible: `page_hidden` is an environment interruption, while `user_cancelled`
means user input stopped capture. For other failures follow the returned reason
and hint; do not work around them by editing the page or stitching screenshots.

For `@eN canvas [visual:screenshot]`, observe returns text, not pixels. Screenshot
that ref when its contents matter; never infer Canvas controls or names from
nearby labels. If images cannot be received/understood, explain the limitation,
ask for an image-capable model when needed, and continue with available semantics.

To click a point seen in a Canvas image, retain that screenshot's `capture_id`:

```sh
bsk click @e3 --capture <capture-id> --image-x <x> --image-y <y> --session <id>
```

Use ORIGINAL PNG coordinates and dimensions, not resized display/viewport pixels.
Captures are single-use, expire after 2m, and are invalidated by ref replacement
(observe/snapshot/continuation) or a newer screenshot of that ref. With
`capture_unavailable`, the image is view-only: observe and screenshot again before
clicking. Counts 1/2, buttons and modifiers work; Canvas fill, IME, drag, hover
and HTML extraction do not. Repainting is allowed; changed identity/geometry/hit
targets are rejected. Verify the result, using DOM refs for revealed controls;
inspect `effect_state=unknown` before retrying with a new capture.

## Files and other tools

```sh
bsk upload @e3 --file ./report.pdf --session <id>
bsk download @e3 --out ./report.pdf --session <id>
```

Upload discloses the file to the site; download accepts site-controlled bytes.
Use agent-local paths, not browser-internal staging paths.

- Default upload clicks an upload button/label and intercepts its file chooser.
- If `reason=file_input_not_activated` and `effect_state=none`, re-observe. Try
`--mode drop` once only on a clear attachment target such as a drop zone or
composer, never whitespace or an ambiguous container. Otherwise follow the
human-help rules. There is no automatic fallback between mechanisms.
- Never retry or switch upload modes for `effect_state=unknown` or `committed`.
A successful drop proves dispatch, not site acceptance; observe the attachment.
- Download refuses overwrite by default; add `--overwrite` only when replacement
is intended. Consult each command's help for other flags.

Use `console` / `network` for bounded read-only diagnostics; follow returned
sequence cursors. `emulate --device iphone-14` affects one tab; `--off` restores it.
`evaluate` is a last resort: inspect JSON `.ok`, since a script exception can have
CLI exit code 0. Never evaluate secrets. `record start` captures user actions;
read its help first and never record banking, SSO or password-manager pages.
Use `bsk --help` to find navigation/history, tab, wait and window commands.
