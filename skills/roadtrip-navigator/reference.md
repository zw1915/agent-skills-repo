# Reference — schema, reliability, tool routing

## 1. tripData schema

The renderer (`assets/template.html`) reads a single `TRIP_DATA` object. Write it
to `tripData.json`, then render with `assets/generate.py`. All fields are
optional except where noted; the renderer degrades gracefully when fields are
missing.

```jsonc

### Optional sections (Phase 3 modules)

These render only when present. Build them with the matching tool, then drop the
result straight into `tripData.json`.

```jsonc
// Multi-route comparison — renders a table near the top (>= 2 options).
// Build with scripts/helper.compare_routes(options, party).
"routeOptions": [
  { "name": "Sea-to-Sky loop", "miles": 450, "days": 4,
    "driveIntensity": "relaxed (~2.0h/day)",   // auto-filled if omitted
    "highlights": "Vancouver, Whistler", "bestSeason": "year-round",
    "estCost": 1680, "pros": "open all year", "cons": "two crossings",
    "chosen": true }
],

// Cross-border — renders a documents/insurance/units checklist per crossing.
// Build with tools/border_client.trip_section([("US","CA",rental), ...]).
// The single-shot webapp path instead has the model emit a top-level
// "crossings":[{"from":"US","to":"CA","day":2}, ...] (structure only) and
// planner.refresh_trip_border builds this section from it — including
// "dutyFree" (customs_client.personal_exemption) when the trip re-enters
// the home country and both crossing days are known.
"crossBorder": {
  "summary": "US→CA · CA→US",
  "crossings": [
    { "from": "US", "to": "CA", "docs": [...], "vehicleDocs": [...],
      "insuranceNote": "...", "customsNotes": [...],
      "unitsAfter": { "distance": "km", "temp": "C", "currency": "CAD", "fuel": "litre" },
      "waitTimes": "CBSA Border Wait Times ...", "estWaitNote": "..." }

                "note": "...", "noteZh": "...", "conditions": [...],
                "conditionsZh": [...], "verify": "..." }   // optional
},

// EV charging corridor — renders a per-leg state-of-charge table.
// Build with tools/charging_client.corridor(legs, usableRange, winter_derate=...).
// Input legs may carry "stops": mid-leg charge stops [{name, powerKW, frac}]
// (frac = 0..1 position along the leg; invalid/missing fracs → even spacing) —
// the leg is then simulated as charger-to-charger sub-legs.

      "chargeTargetPct": 49,            // set whenever a top-up is needed here
      "midLeg": true,                   // only on sub-legs from a mid-leg stop
      "dayIndex": 0,                    // index into days[] (when built per-day)
      "note": "WON'T MAKE IT ...",      // only when a leg fails the buffer
      "shortByMiles": 258,              // ditto: miles missing to reach minSoC

  ],
  "warnings": ["..."]
}
```

### Renderer guarantees
- Map: one numbered marker per stop with lat/lng (in day order) + dashed
  polyline + popup with Google/Apple Maps deep links. Empty/absent coords → map
  hides and a fallback note appears (offline-safe).
- `region` picks the color theme. `vehicle.type` picks 🚗/🔌/🚐.
- Budget rows show a colored reliability badge; the footer total is the source
  of truth (generator warns if `total` ≠ sum of items).
- `budget.currency` / `units.currency` map to symbols: USD `$`, CAD `C$`,
  MXN `MX$`, CNY/RMB `¥`; unknown codes fall back to `$`.

## 2. Reliability grading

Tag every researched figure so the user knows how much to trust it:

| Grade | Badge | Meaning | Use for |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| `verified` | green | from an official/authoritative source this run | NPS fees, park-pass price, confirmed hours |
| `reference` | accent `~` | a real but indicative price/figure (not booked) | hotel nightly rates, tour prices, rental quotes |
| `estimate` | grey `≈` | computed or rough | fuel cost, food totals, "misc" |

Default to the **lowest** grade you can honestly claim. Never label something
`verified` unless this run actually confirmed it. An honest ≈ outranks a
borrowed ✓.

## 3. Tool routing table

Every tool has a web-search fallback so the skill runs even when nothing is
installed. **Delegation rule:** when fanning out to sub-agents, instruct them to
hit official/free APIs first and fall back to web search only on failure.

| Concern | Preferred source | Client | Fallback |
|---------|------------------|--------|----------|
| Place-name validation (Step 1) | **Photon geocoder (OSM, no key)** | `tools/places_client.py` | ask the user — never plan around an unverified name |
| Route / miles / drive time | Google/Apple Directions, OSRM (OSM) | `tools/routing_client.py` | web search estimate |
| Map tiles | **Leaflet + OSM (no key)** | built into template | — |
| National park info | **NPS API (free)** | `tools/parks_client.py` | nps.gov scrape / search |
| Campgrounds / permits | **Recreation.gov** | `tools/parks_client.py` | official link + countdown |
| Weather (per day) | **NWS api.weather.gov (US, free)**, Env. Canada | `tools/weather_client.py` | OpenWeather / search |
| EV charging | Open Charge Map (free), PlugShare, ABRP idea | `tools/charging_client.py` | search chargers |
| EV corridor (SoC精算) | linear range model | `tools/charging_client.corridor()` | `leg_ok()` quick check |
| Cross-border checklist | CBP / CBSA / Banjercito rules | `tools/border_client.py` | search current rules |
| Duty-free exemption (免税额) | CBP / CBSA / SAT rules table | `tools/customs_client.py` | search current allowances |
| Multi-route compare | computed | `scripts/helper.compare_routes()` | — |
| Fuel price | GasBuddy | `tools/fuel_client.py` | regional average estimate |
| Lodging / campgrounds | Booking/Expedia/Airbnb (+携程 city pages, China-domestic only), KOA/Hipcamp | `tools/lodging_client.py` | search reference price |
| Hikes | AllTrails | (via `web_search`) | search |
| Scenic byways | FHWA National Scenic Byways | (via `web_search`) | search |
| Live road conditions / closures | State DOT 511, Caltrans, park alerts | `tools/weather_client.py` notes | search |
| Real-world reviews | Reddit r/roadtrip, r/nationalparks, blogs | `tools/web_search.py` | — |

### Client contract
Each `tools/*.py` exposes simple functions returning plain dicts/lists and a
`FALLBACK` note when it could not reach a live source. None require API keys to
*run* — without a key they return a structured "use web search" fallback rather
than crashing. Read keys from environment variables (e.g. `NPS_API_KEY`,
`OCM_API_KEY`, `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`); `NWS`, `OSRM`, `Photon`, and
`Open Charge Map` (demo) need no key.

## 4. Daily-drive defaults (Step 3 validation)

| Party | Relaxed daily drive | Hard cap |
|-------|--------------------|----------|
| Adults only | 4–5 h | ~6.5 h |
| With kids / seniors | 3–4 h | ~5 h |
| RV / towing | 3–4 h | ~5 h |

Also check: arrival before dark (sunset varies by season/latitude), no stop
arrival after a gate/closing time, and a fuel/charge point on any leg longer
than ~60–70% of the vehicle's tank/usable range.

## 5. Seasonal closure cheat-sheet (verify each trip)

| Road / pass | Typical closure |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Going-to-the-Sun Rd (Glacier) | ~mid-Oct → late Jun/Jul |
| Tioga Pass (Yosemite, CA-120) | ~Nov → late May/Jun |
| Trail Ridge Rd (RMNP) | ~mid-Oct → late May |
| Beartooth Hwy (US-212) | ~mid-Oct → late May |
| Many Glacier / high passes | snow-dependent |

Other seasonal hazards: wildfire (late summer/fall, West), hurricane (Jun–Nov,
Gulf/Atlantic/SE), winter storms (mountains, Midwest, Northeast). Always confirm
against live park alerts and DOT 511 — this table is a starting prompt, not truth.
