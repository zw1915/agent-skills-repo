planner.py — Phase 2: full itinerary generation, single-day regeneration, and
post-processing (endpoint snapping, map-pin de-stacking) for a planned trip.

Used by the roadtrip-webapp (imported via the skill submodule's scripts/
directory on sys.path, same as routes.py) and callable standalone for testing.

Public API
----------
live_mode() -> bool
    True when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set and the anthropic package is importable.
generate_trip(payload, live, on_progress=None, log_fn=None) -> dict
    Full flow: plan (live or demo) + schema defaults + endpoint/pin fixups.
    This is the one call the webapp needs — pass it a form payload and get
    back a tripData dict ready for generate.py to render.
plan_live(payload, region, on_progress=None, log_fn=None) -> dict
    One streaming Claude call, framed by SKILL.md + reference.md, that emits
    the full tripData JSON. `on_progress` receives {"step"|"expectedChars"|
    "charsReceived": ...} events a caller can use to drive a progress UI.
plan_demo(payload, region, on_progress=None) -> dict
    Offline fallback: serve the closest curated sample tripData.
regenerate_day(trip, day_index, comment_body, log_fn=None) -> dict
    Rewrite a single day of an existing trip per a commenter's request.
remove_city(trip, day_start, day_end, city_name="", log_fn=None) -> dict
    Trip edit: delete one overnight stop's days, regenerate the single joined
    driving day (one model call), then resequence dates, refresh totals and —
    where a real forecast covers the new dates — weather. Mutates only after
    the model call succeeds; raises on an invalid span or model failure.
set_nights(trip, day_start, day_end, city_name, nights, log_fn=None) -> dict
    Trip edit: change how long one overnight stop lasts. The city's run of
    days is rewritten as `nights` days by one model call (arrival driving leg
    preserved verbatim), then the same deterministic cascade as remove_city
    runs (dates, totals, lodging nights, weather). Same atomicity contract.
revise_stay(trip, day_start, day_end, city_name, instruction, nights=None,
            log_fn=None) -> dict
    Trip edit: rewrite one stay per a free-text traveler request, optionally
    resizing it in the same single model call. Same guards/cascade/atomicity.
fix_endpoints(trip, start, destination) -> None
    Snap the first/last stop coordinates to the real start/destination.
despread_stops(trip) -> None
    Nudge/re-geocode stops whose coordinates collide so map pins separate.
refresh_trip_weather(trip) -> dict
    Replace each day's weather with a real forecast (source="forecast") or, past
    the forecast window, a seasonal climatology average (source="climatology").
    Called on generate and when a trip page is opened. Best-effort.
weather_advisories(trip) -> list[dict|None]
    Per-day weather advisories (deterministic, no model call), aligned with
    trip['days']: None, or {severity, source, condition, message}. Only days
    with a provenance tag get one; language follows trip['lang'].
geocode(query, timeout=3.0) -> {"lat","lng"} | None
geocode_near(query, lat, lng, timeout=3.0) -> {"lat","lng"} | None
    Best-effort Photon geocoding (free, no key), the latter biased to a locale.
